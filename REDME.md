## Introduction

### Booth's Multiplication

Booth's algorithm is an efficient technique for multiplying binary numbers, particularly useful for handling signed integers.

### Non-Restoring Division

The non-restoring division algorithm is used for dividing signed binary numbers without explicitly restoring the remainder during the process.

## Algorithms

### Booth's Multiplication: Steps

1. Convert both numbers to binary.
2. Use Booth's encoding to determine additions and shifts.
3. Perform signed binary multiplication using a 2's complement method.
4. Extract the final product from the accumulator.

### Non-Restoring Division: Steps

1. Convert dividend and divisor to binary.
2. Initialize the accumulator to zero.
3. Perform left shifts and conditional additions/subtractions.
4. Determine the quotient and remainder based on final values.
